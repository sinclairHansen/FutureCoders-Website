        As a CS student, I've noticed the importance of having coding resources early on in education. The field can be quite
        competitive, and having community support can help students improve their skills exponentially. That's my goal for 
        Future Coders Foundation, and I look forward to sharing a skill that I find very enjoyable with my community.
