        We founded Future Coders in 2024 after noticing that CS programs were getting more selective and the job market was getting more competitive. Students who had access to programming 
        resources early on are more likely to be successful in the field. While trying to find ways to support students in under-served communities we noticed that many students didn't 
        have access to basic technology required for computer programming. Our goal is to repurpose old 
        laptops and donate them to students in need with the help of local non-profits and schools.</p>
